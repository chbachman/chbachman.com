        So this site isn't great, and I'm well aware. I made it in an afternoon,
        with a couple of goals:
      </p>

      <h2>No Javascript</h2>
      <p>Unless you are building a web app, you don't need it.</p>

      <h2>No Build System</h2>
      <p>
        I considered something like
        <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a>, but I discarded the
        idea for a couple of reasons. Mainly, I don't want a build system. A
        build system involves maintenance, which is something I don't want. The
        first version of this site involved a complicated SASS, Babel,
        Angular.js compile step, but that broke pretty quickly. Text files are
        forever.
      </p>

      <h2>Extremely Small</h2>
      <p>
        The front page of this site is less than 1kb. Not many sites can say
        that. I expect that to grow as I make this site less ugly, but not by
        much, ideally.
      </p>

      <h2>Entirely Custom</h2>
      <p>
        I'd rather not have to deal with the treadmill of CSS frameworks, so
        this CSS is custom. It's not great CSS, but I'm not a CSS developer for
        now.
