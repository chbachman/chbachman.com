# Tier 1

## Excavator

**Score: 10/10**

This is an amazing relic. Mining is already a easy 99 with [Seren Stones](https://runescape.wiki/w/Seren_stone), a fifteen minute AFK for training mining. But this makes Smithing, Crafting, Archaeology, and Mining a easy 99. And since Arch in particular gives [huge benefits to other skills](https://runescape.wiki/w/Relics) (almost replacing the other two options in this tier, ironically), this one is the obvious pick.

It also makes [Signs of the Porter](https://runescape.wiki/w/Sign_of_the_porter) easy to get. The hard part of making them is the necklaces. Necklaces are made from Gold Bars and Gems, which the auto processing/banking parts of this relic makes trivial to get.

### Details:

- Grants a pickaxe that provides Mining and Archaeology benefits, counting as both a pickaxe and a mattock.
- While training Mining with the tool equipped:
  - Bank ores automatically.
    > **Equivalent:** [Porters](https://runescape.wiki/w/Sign_of_the_porter)
    >
    > Realistically this is auto-depositing bars. And bars are incredibly useful. You need large amounts of them to make [Masterwork Melee](https://runescape.wiki/w/Masterwork_melee_equipment), some of the best armor in the game.
  - Ores are automatically smelted into bars.
    > This is huge, as it drastically cuts down on the amount of mining you need. Instead of mining 3 ores for [Elder Rune Bar](https://runescape.wiki/w/Elder_rune_bar), you (probably) only need to mine a single Elder Rune Ore and you get the bar.
  - Gems are automatically cut.
    > This gives you free Crafting XP, especially with a gem rock.
  - Double damage during Rockertunities
    > This isn't a huge deal, it's maybe a 10% speedup of mining.
- While training Archaeology with the tool equipped:
  - Bank archaeology materials automatically.
    > **Equivalent:** [Porters](https://runescape.wiki/w/Sign_of_the_porter)
    >
    > Arch materials are precious, as they are needed to progress arch, and so this is useful. You also need a ton of them. Arch is also a 15 minute AFK with this which is super nice.
  - 5x Chronote gain.
    > Chronotes are used to switch Arch relics (unrelated from Leagues Relics), and so are somewhat useful. This means you'll never need to worry about it.
  - Material costs to restore artifacts are halved.
    > This is huge. Arch is balanced where you get less materials than you need for restoring artefacts. The idea being that on a non-ironman you want to buy Arch materials, giving them resale value. As an ironman, that's not an option so Arch is just slower, with you always wanting materials. This solves that, making Arch basically twice as fast as it normally is.
  - Time sprites are stationary and follow the player.
    > This makes AFKing just as fast as normal, making AFK Arch one of the best things to do.
- Archaeology journal acts as a free soil screener.
  > I'm not sure if this means an active soil screener (good, but not amazing) or a passive soil screener (like the [Auto Screener](https://runescape.wiki/w/Auto-screener_v1.080)), which is amazing.
- Geodes have a chance of containing Archaeology materials.
  > Nice, but not a huge deal.

## Divine Woodcutter

**Score: 2/10**

This is a niche pick, where basically the only thing that matters in it is the Divination benefits, which is useful (Divination sucks to train), but it's not a huge enough benefit to be worth it.

### Details:

- Grants a powerful hatchet for both Woodcutting and Divination.
- While training Woodcutting with the tool equipped:
  - Logs can be automatically burnt
    > **Equivalent:** [Superheat Form](https://runescape.wiki/w/Superheat_Form) (91 Prayer)
    > **Equivalent:** [Always Adze](https://runescape.wiki/w/Always_Adze) (83 Arch)
    >
    > This is useful, but it's pretty easily replaced, especially by 83 Arch which isn't hard to get with Excavator.
  - Unburnt logs and bird nests are sent to the bank
    > **Equivalent:** [Porters](https://runescape.wiki/w/Sign_of_the_porter)
    >
    > Logs are useful for training Firemaking + Fletching, but otherwise aren't the most useful thing in the world.
- While training Divination with the tool equipped:
  - Memories are automatically deposited straight into the rift
    > **Equivalent:** [Memory Dowser](https://runescape.wiki/w/Memory_dowser) (80 Divination)
    > **Partial Equivalent:** [Divine Conversion](https://runescape.wiki/w/Divine_Conversion) (98 Arch)
    >
    > This is undeniably a huge speedup for Divination, and both of the equivalents aren't perfect replacements. But Memory Dowser is pretty close (only missing slight distance) after 80 divination and some short grinding for a rare drop.
  - Chronicles are captured instantly
    > **Equivalent:** [Chronicle Attraction](https://runescape.wiki/w/Chronicle_Attraction) (87 Prayer)
    >
    > This isn't a huge deal.
  - Energy springs last 60 seconds longer
    > Makes Divination more AFK, but not a ton more AFK
  - Double divine energy from springs and memory conversions
    > Useful, especially for gathering divine charges.

## Animal Wrangler

**Score: 0/10**

Hunter isn't a useful skill outside of some niche uses, and it's somewhat fast to train. Fishing is a useful skill, but basically only for food. Food is useful for sure, but you don't need a ridiculous amount of it.

### Details:

- Grants a powerful harpoon for both Fishing and Hunter.
- While training Fishing with the tool equipped:
  - No bait required for fishing
    > Bait is ridiculously cheap, this does nothing.
  - 50% increased catch rate for all fish > This is either a 50% (multiplicative) bonus to fishing, AKA a 50% speedup, which is not great. Or it's a 50% additive bonus to fishing chance, which is actually really good and speeds up fishing a huge amount.
  - All fish caught are sent to the bank
    > **Equivalent:** [Porters](https://runescape.wiki/w/Sign_of_the_porter)
    >
    > Fish are useful for easy food, which is a nice thing to have.
  - Fish can be automatically cooked
    > **Equivalent:** [Bait and Switch](https://runescape.wiki/w/Bait_and_Switch) (99 Arch)
    > This is nice, but has an Arch equivalent. It does mean Cooking is a free AFK skill.
- While training Hunter with the tool equipped:
  - Traps never fail
    > This is nice, but most meta hunter training methods already don't have traps failing.
  - All Hunter loot is sent to the bank
    > **Equivalent:** [Porters](https://runescape.wiki/w/Sign_of_the_porter)
    >
    > Hunter loot doesn't matter a ton. Somewhat useful, but not a huge deal.
  - Double Hunter loot
    > Same as above, hunter loot doesn't matter a ton. This is mostly useful for Chinchompas.

# Tier 2 (Not Confirmed)

## Farming Frenzy

**Score: 8/10**

This is a really good pick (assuming the tiers are correct), as while farming isn't a super important skill, Herblore is. Herblore is such an important skill it's almost required to hit 110+ on the skill, which is a huge pain for ironmen. This relic not only takes the pain of farming herb seeds out of the equation, but also gives you anywhere from 3 (if using ultracompost) to 6 (if not using compost) times as many herbs guaranteed, with additional chances of improving yields further.

### Details

- A range of benefits to nurture your farming skills.
- Patches are harvested instantly and products are automatically noted.
  > This is a speedup, but not a huge one. Produce can already be noted. However, combined with below, it's a speedup.
- Seeds planted instantly grow to full.
  > This is crazy good. It means that each seed instantly grows, turning Farming from a skill about waiting around for stuff into a pretty quick processing skill.
- 15% chance of increased crop yield.
  > Good, but compared with everything else somewhat underwhelming.
- All patches are always treated with ultracompost.
  > Not having to deal with compost is always nice, and ultracompost is a pain to get.
- 20% chance to save planted seeds when sowing.
  > Seeds lasting a little while longer is good, but it's an incremental benefit.
- Plant max herbs using a single seed.
  > This is huge. You get about 4x the amount of herbs than you would normally, for the same cost. Herbs are super useful for Herblore, a really important skill.

## Five Finger Discount

**Score: 5/10**

This is an AFK relic. It's not optimal, but it gives you a ton of stuff with a 15 minute AFK time. Some examples:

- [Pickpocketing Hefin Workers](https://runescape.wiki/w/Hefin_worker) for Prayer XP.
- [Pickpocketing Crux Equal Knights](https://runescape.wiki/w/Crux_Eqal_Knight) for seeds.
- [Pickpocketing Amlodd Workers](https://runescape.wiki/w/Amlodd_worker) for Porters, Divine Energy, and Summoning Charms.
- [Pickpocketing Iorweth Workers](https://runescape.wiki/w/Iorwerth_worker) for Potions, Sharks.
- [Gem Stalls](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Gem_stall_(Keldagrim)>) for Crafting XP.

Is it a good option? No. But it is a OK option if you want way more ways to AFK.

### Details

- Significantly improve your thieving abilities.
- Never fail a thieving check.
  > This is useful, as there are some good thieving targets, and you'll have good AFK access to them.
- All thieving loot is noted.
  > **Equivalent:** [Thieving Cape Perk](https://runescape.wiki/w/Thieving_cape#Perk) (99 Thieving)
  >
  > It's good, but since Thieving is an easy 99, not super useful.
- Stealing from stalls does not cause them to deplete.
  > There's like no good stalls in the game. Maybe the [lamp stall](https://runescape.wiki/w/Lamp_stall), or [gem stall](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Gem_stall_(Keldagrim)>)?
- Reduce safe cracking cooldown to 1 minute.
  > This makes safe cracking a lot easier, and safe cracking is the best way to train thieving. However, it's already really fast (~500k xp/hour base game)

## Golden Footed

**Score: 2/10**

This isn't a great pick, but it gives you 2 things:

1. A pretty good gp/hour method (120k gp/hour per agility level)
2. Agility as a free 99

Agility sucks as a 99, and gp isn't the easiest thing in the world, so it's not totally useless.

### Details

- Grants a pair of boots that ensure a surefooted approach to agility.
- Goldenhawk boots grant you agility experience periodically while running (every 10 ticks), skilling, or when using ultimate abilities.
  > Agility becomes a free 99
- Upon completing an agility course lap, receive 1,000 coins per agility level.
  > The fastest Agility course is ~30 seconds, so this means at level 99 Agility this is actually a pretty good income (~10m gp/hour)
- Upon completing an agility course lap, the agility xp for completing the lap is +200%.
  > This really doesn't matter given you'll have 99 agility anyway.
- Prevents you from failing any agility course obstacles and shortcuts.

  > **Equivalent:** [Agility Cape Perk](https://runescape.wiki/w/Agility_cape#Perk) (99 Agility)
  >
  > This also doesn't matter since there isn't anything super useful, and the Agility Cape does the same thing.

# Untiered

## Perkfection

**Score: 8/10**

This has 3 main parts:

- Augments don't consume energy: Makes divination much less needed
- Infinite Invention materials: This is essentially free perfect Gizmos (used for PvM), as well as very cheap things like
- Very Good Money: Useful for Summoning, Prayer, Construction, and Shops.

All of those are good, and so this is a very powerful relic.

### Details

- Gain an incredible stack of invention related boosts!
- Access to infinite Invention materials.
  > This is a huge deal. Many invention materials are a huge pain to get, coming from high level boss drops or clue scroll rewards. This lets you skip all of that.
- Augmented items and machines consume no charge.
  > This is a nice Quality of Life, as Divination becomes much less useful. Augmented items using Divination energy to recharge is the number 1 cost center for most PvM.
- Helpful perks will trigger 10% more often (does not stack with item level 20 benefit).
  > This is a nice side benefit, but not a huge deal. It's multiplicative, so it's really a like ~1% DPS increase, if that.
- Invention machines will run twice as fast
  > This is also a nice QoL, but not a huge one. Invention Machines are useful, but given the insane bonuses other relics gives, this one doesn't stand out as much.
- When disassembling or alchemising items manually, gain the resources from both actions (does not effect[sic] machines or cleaners).
  > This basically means you always want to disassemble. It stacks, is faster, and doesn't cost nature runes.
- When disassembling or alchemising items manually, have a 66% chance to save the resource (does not effect[sic] machines or cleaners).
  > This is enough that you'll probably profit buying things from shops [Golden God](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Golden_God) style, so this is essentially infinite GP. It's not as broken as Golden God was though, so it's a really good AFK money maker, but not literally infinite money.
- Unlock all blueprints in the dwarven and goblin tech tree.
  > This is somewhat useful. It helps with acquiring the [Oldak Coil](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Oldak_coil_(blueprint)>), [Kinetic Cyclone](https://runescape.wiki/w/Kinetic_cyclone), and [Venomblood](https://runescape.wiki/w/Venomblood). But it's not a huge time sink, just a slightly time gated one.

## Production Master

**Score: 8/10**

This speeds up processing skills. Processing skills are interesting because they tend to be pretty fast, but require large amounts of input resources to do which can take a while. For example, Herblore is one of the fastest skills in the game, but it takes a ridiculous amount of herbs as input. So overall it's slow, but only because you have to collect resources.

This speeds up the actual processing part (the fast part), and helps some with the input part by giving you about 20-30% more output via the various bonuses it gives.

It also opens the door for training using worse methods since it's so much faster.

### Details

- Grants the Brooch of the Elder Gods.
  > This is an improved version of the [Brooch of the Gods](https://runescape.wiki/w/Brooch_of_the_Gods), which is a good item to have, and difficult to get (assuming Hydrix are difficult to get).
- Various production activities will have their items processed at once
  > This is anywhere from a 10x speedup (Herblore, Fletching) to a 28x speedup (Cooking), which is obviously really good.
- You will never burn food accidentally
  > **Equivalent:** [Cooking Cape Perk](https://runescape.wiki/w/Cooking_cape#Perk) (99 Cooking)
- Your Brooch of the Elder Gods will supply infinite urns
  > This is in essence about a 20% speedup to Cooking, Divination, Farming, Fishing, Hunter, Mining, Runecrafting, Smithing and Woodcutting. Not amazing like a doubling, but good.
- While the the Brooch of the Elder Gods is equipped:
  - You will gain the benefits of Portable skilling stations even while not using one
    > See [here](https://runescape.wiki/w/Portable_skilling_stations#Usage_and_benefits) for a full list of benefits, but it's more or less a 20% boost to Firemaking, Crafting, Fletching, Cooking, and Herblore.
  - You can spawn Seren spirits, Divine blessings, Catalysts of alteration and Manifested knowledge
    > [Seren spirits](https://runescape.wiki/w/Seren_spirit) have useful supplies, [Divine Blessings](https://runescape.wiki/w/Divine_blessing) have useful invention components, [Catalysts of Alteration](https://runescape.wiki/w/Catalyst_of_alteration) have Clue Scrolls, and [Manifested Knowledge](https://runescape.wiki/w/Manifested_knowledge) gives slightly more xp. None of these are unique to this, and so all have equivalents, just not easy ones.
- You will gain a +6 boost to Smithing, Herblore, Cooking, Crafting and Construction.
  > Useful, but not crazily so. Gives you better training opportunities and prevents from having to go as high in skills like Herblore if you don't want to.

## Banker's Note

**Score: 7/10**

Is this worse than the OSRS version? Yes. Is it still really good? Also yes. I'm sure this tier will be a difficult option, as the pure quality of life of never needing to bank when you forgot something is crazy.

### Details

- Receive the banker's note inventory item.
- Grants access to your Bank from almost anywhere in the world.
  > This is super useful, not only for resupplying in PvM, but also for just grabbing items you forgot.
- The "activate" option allows you to note and unnote items in one action, with a specified quantity. You can set this amount by using the item on the note.
- Manually use items on the Banker's note to note and unnote items directly into your inventory.
  > This is useful in 2 ways: Unnoting supplies, and noting production. It's really useful, but less than in OSRS given that Porters exist for gathering skills, Bank Presets exist for production, and PvM encounters don't tend to last as long (there's no equivalent of Inferno really).
