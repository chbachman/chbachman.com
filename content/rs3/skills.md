# Combat

Ideally when training Combat Skills you should also train Slayer at the same time. A lot of Slayer tasks are AFK, Good Money Makers, and train Slayer. However, if that's not possible, here's some good AFK Combat Methods:

Note: For all of these you'll need some form of sustain. Examples (by general quality) include:

- Barbarism Relic
- [Soul Split](https://runescape.wiki/w/Soul_Split): 92 Prayer
- [Blood Amulet](https://runescape.wiki/w/Blood_necklace_shard): 80 Crafting, 115 Dungeoneering
- [Bunyip](https://runescape.wiki/w/Bunyip): 81 Summoning
- [Unicorn](https://runescape.wiki/w/Unicorn_stallion): 88 Summoning
- [Saradomin Godsword](https://runescape.wiki/w/Saradomin_godsword): 75 Attack
- Food (not AFK)

Most of these have high requirements, which means that really AFK Training isn't worth it until later on. Soul Split in particular is a huge deal, and so 92 Prayer is a really good goal early.

## [The Abyss](https://runescape.wiki/w/Abyss/Combat_training)

This is a relatively low requirement AFK Training spot, but I guarantee it'll be super crowded.

# Prayer

To start out with, you want to get the highest tier of [Underworld Grimoire](https://runescape.wiki/w/Underworld_Grimoire) you can, as it makes collecting bones easy.

## Bones Methods

| Method                                                                         | XP Bonus | Requirements        | Notes        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| [Chaos Altar](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Chaos_altar_(Wilderness)>)             | 350%     | None                | Inconvenient |
| [Tier 1 Fort (No Burners)](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Chapel_(Fort_Forinthry)>) | 250%     | 15 Construction     |              |
| [Tier 1 Fort (Burners)](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Chapel_(Fort_Forinthry)>)    | 258%     | 15 Construction     | Need Herbs   |
| [Tier 2 Fort (No Burners)](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Chapel_(Fort_Forinthry)>) | 300%     | 55 Construction     |              |
| [Tier 2 Fort (Burners)](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Chapel_(Fort_Forinthry)>)    | 318%     | 55 Construction     | Need Herbs   |
| [Tier 3 Fort (No Burners)](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Chapel_(Fort_Forinthry)>) | 350%     | 90 Construction     |              |
| [Tier 3 Fort (Burners)](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Chapel_(Fort_Forinthry)>)    | 385%     | 90 Construction     | Need Herbs   |
| [Powder of Burials](https://runescape.wiki/w/Powder_of_burials)                | 350%     | 90 Hunter + Farming | Faster       |

In priority order:

1. Tier 3 Fort (Burners) - If you have 90 Construction, this is where all your bones should go.
2. Chaos Altar - This is a pain to get to, so you'll want to stockpile bones before coming here and using either a Banker's Note or Last Recall.
3. Best Tier Fort you have access to.

## Bone Free Methods

### [Cleansing Crystals](https://runescape.wiki/w/Ironman_Mode/Strategies/Prayer#Levels_75+:_Cleansing_crystal)

**Requirements:** 75 Prayer, [Lots of GP](/rs3/howtoget#gp)

### [Vyres](https://runescape.wiki/w/Vyrewatch/Strategies)

**Requirements:** [River of Blood](https://runescape.wiki/w/River_of_Blood), Some form of sustain

This involves using the Sunspear to kill Vyrewatch, which gives good Prayer XP. It does take relatively high combat stats + Soul Split to do this AFK though (at least in base game).
