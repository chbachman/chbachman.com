# Apple

## Fitness+

I helped build [Apple Fitness+](https://www.apple.com/apple-fitness-plus/). There was enough of these releases, it makes sense to breakdown the work by release:

### iOS 14.3 - Fitness+ Initial Launch

[Apple Page](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/12/apple-fitness-plus-the-future-of-fitness-launches-december-14/)

As one of the first couple of engineers that worked on Fitness+, I got to work on the backend servers as well as the database. I specifically was in charge of iCloud Syncing and the CoreData Database, as well as worked with others on the Burn Bar.

### iOS 15 - Resume Workout

This wasn't a large feature because it was a shortened timeframe, as we released pretty late into the year. One of the biggest complaints that we had was that users would lose a workout because they wanted to take a break in the middle. I added a feature that let you resume a workout partway through, which was more difficult than it sounded due to the fact that most of our code had the assumption that the playback position of the video equals the duration of the workout. This was my first challenge that involved editing a ton of other people's code without causing regressions.

### iOS 16 - Fitness+ on iPhone

A hard feature to name, but it's the opening of Fitness+ to non Apple Watch users. This involved a ton of work again to violate assumptions we had made when building Fitness+ initially, and this time on a much larger scale.

This feature got specific time during the September Keynote that year, as well as placement on Apple's homepage for a couple of weeks.

### iOS 17 - Fitness+ Custom Plans

This was a big feature for a lot of reasons. First, it was the first feature that I worked on in a while that was truly new. Before it was editing assumptions and mostly tweaks to existing codebases. Plans was a big new thing, with a team to match. I ended up leading that team as what was essentially a Technical Lead role. I spent a lot of my time working with engineers to make sure everything fit together as well as working with Design + AI experts to fit those pieces in a way that everyone could agree on.

In the end, I think we landed on a really nice feature, but it really did take a journey to get there.

## Photos

I transferred to work on the watchOS Photos App, and helped to build the new watchOS 11 Photos Face. This was a new codebase, with a new group of people and a very ambitious feature. I ended up designing the entire Phone <-> Watch communication stack and dealing with the logistics of selecting, processing, and syncing photos. This was a year extremely focused on performance, as we had very tight limits in what we could do, including a strict 5MB memory limit and limitations on when and where we could do work.

# BMW

I was an intern at BMW for 2 summers during college, during which I helped build UI Testing frameworks for other BMW Engineers for their iOS App. The second summer I did development on the actual iOS App.
