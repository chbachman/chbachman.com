# Modular Armour

[GitHub](https://github.com/chbachman/ModularArmour) | [Download](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modular-armour)

A Minecraft Mod that's goal was to make "the only armor set you ever needed". It received over half a million downloads. Made in my spare time during high school and honestly not very good. Taught me a lot though.

Written in entirely self-taught Java.

This was an attempt to write my own compiler for Kotlin/Swift/Something Else that would compile to readable C. The idea behind it was that I hated my classes in college that would require raw C, as I missed a ton of the features from other languages. My obvious solution was to write a compiler that would take a subset of Kotlin/Swift and turn it into C code that I could then submit to professors.

I did end up using it for a couple of assignments, but unfortunately for my plans I didn't take into account making a compiler takes longer than a semester and by that point I was out of C classes, so it was never finished. Learned a ton about compilers in the process though.

At this point, my personal projects dry up, as most everything I wrote was related to my job or never bothered releasing due to the small size.

This is my fourth? fifth? attempt at doing this. This started life as a super simple Jekyll instance hosted on GitHub pages, moved into a fancy AngularJS Application, and then died due to lack of maintenance and AngularJS being killed. I've revived it post Apple as a way to both advertise my job history (hello recruiters) and also complain about games in blog posts.

This time it's a Hugo blog hosted on Cloudflare Pages, made with (at least currently) the [Hugo Bear Blog Theme](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog) as I've given up trying to learn CSS well enough to make my own website from scratch.
