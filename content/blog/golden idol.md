Mystery games have a central problem. How does the game know that you, as the player, have solved the mystery? If the mystery is simple, this is easy. If all you need to know is who did it or which key is the correct one then the player has an obvious way to show mastery. Just accuse the murderer or use the correct key.

But while those types of mysteries are fine for an occasional quest in a larger game (e.g. [KOTOR](https://w.wiki/FDgL)) it's not enough for a full on mystery game. Each game has to solve this separately.

Case of the Golden Idol is a mystery/puzzle game where you solve "strange occurrences" (it's mostly murders).

It does this by having a "thinking screen" that you have to fill in with answers from a word bank. It works really well, as it (mostly) solves the largest issue with mystery games: How to let the player indicate that they know what is going on without making it either braindead easy (point to the person who did it) or extremely difficult (enter freeform text into a textbox).
