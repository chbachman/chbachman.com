        A quintessential example, and in fact the origin of the term,
        <em>Jiminy Cockthroat</em> - AKA an Open World Stealth Action with
        Crafting and Collectibles - AKA the standard Ubisoft Sandbox formula.
      </p>
      <p>Let’s take a look at each part and how it’s done:</p>
      <h2 id="open-world">Open World</h2>
      <p>
        This is the most gorgeous open world I’ve ever seen. Areas have distinct
        feelings, the focus on the wind rustling through long grass and trees
        means that the world is dynamic, even in still settings, and many areas
        seem designed to leave amazing screenshots. I often paused just to
        admire the scenery, something which very few games will cause me to want
        to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the world is lacking in direction. A good open world draws you
        to its interesting points without needing to guide you there with
        markers on a map. Ghost of Tsushima doesn’t do that. You are constantly
        following its version of a dotted line. A pretty dotted line, but a
        dotted line nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, you don’t need to follow it all of the time. Just by being pretty,
        the world makes you want to explore it. However, even this is undermined
        by the invisible walls that are constantly placed in your way while
        exploring. Not actual invisible walls (most of the time), but quest
        trigger invisible walls. An area will be completely empty, or just have
        nothing to do. In the beginning of the game, this is confusing. However,
        as you progress you start to learn that the game doesn’t want you there
        yet, and just leave, slightly disappointed in the total lack of a reward
        for finding a cool area.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, early on you explore and hear so much about the town
        “Komatsu Forge”. It had been built up in my mind so much that I searched
        for it. Once I found it, it was completely empty. A ghost town. At that
        point, I did a bit of research and found out that you need to get to a
        certain point in the main quest before you can do anything there. Once
        you get to that point, the town becomes filled with enemies that you
        clear out in the course of the quest. Immersion breaking to say the
        least. This happens throughout your exploration, to the point that by
        the end, I stopped exploring and just followed the quests and small
        other areas the game wants you to visit.
      </p>
      <h2 id="stealth">Stealth</h2>
      <p>
        The stealth in this game is fine, but it's two things that kill stealth. 
		It's slow, and it's useless. Slow is fine, whatever. But useless kills stealth.
		Action is just too fun, and stealth is kinda boring. Sneaking past enemies is only
		good as a challenge, and is basically never required from a gameplay reason.
		Every time I sat around stealthing, I thought to myself "can't I just slice these dudes?"
		And the answer every time was "yes, I can."
      </p>
      <h2 id="action">Action</h2>
      <p>
        The combat starts out easy, and gets easier as the game goes along. I
        had to stop myself from using the best armor and weapons I received
        because otherwise the game was too easy. Every enemy (with only a few
        exceptions) can be beaten simply by mashing strong attack and then once
        their guard is broken, masking weak attack. There are even armor sets
        that make this even easier, which further adds to the trivialization.
      </p>
      <h2 id="crafting">Crafting</h2>
      <p>
        Barely present in the game, and entirely unnecessary. Would have been
        better removed. They have so many quests that give you no real reward,
        but make you search the world for simple things to upgrade your armor
        and weapons, when those could be rewards for completing quests, to make
        the quests actually worth doing.
      </p>
      <h2 id="collectibles">Collectibles</h2>
      <p>
        There are a lot of them, and they come in two forms: 1. Areas in the
        world 2. Things in the world
      </p>
      <p>
        The areas in the world are great. They help encourage exploration, fit
        in with the world, and give tangible benefits. I was always excited to
        find a Fox Den, or a Bamboo Strike, because they involve the open world
        in a good way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The things in the world, honestly suck. They are hard to find and lead
        to distracting the core gameplay, which is exploring and fighting. The
        collectibles you gather this way are worthless, and honestly I would
        have skipped if my preferred armor wasn’t bugging me about collecting
        them constantly.
      </p>
      <h2 id="story">Story</h2>
      <p>
        The story is both simplistic and pretentious, which is a hard combo to
        pull off. The main enemy of the game, the fodder the game throws at you
        for the entire game is the Mongol Empire. They are never redeemed. They
        never rise above the level of “bad guy” and you never feel guilty for
        killing thousands of them. They are constantly shown killing civilians
        and there is never a choice anywhere in the game that lets you see them
        in anything besides a killing force that you should be glad to butcher.
        The Mongols are the simplistic aspect of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game gets pretentious when it goes over the other aspect to the
        story, honor. As a game set in Feudal Japan, Ghost of Tsushima is
        obsessed with honor and which of your actions are honorable and which
        are dishonorable. However, this doesn’t translate to anything in the
        gameplay and you are railroaded into taking dishonorable actions in
        front of large amounts of people so that the story can have tension. It
        comes off a pretentious because both sides are caricatures of the main
        question of “Does honor matter?” One side believes anything besides
        charging straight at an enemy in while yelling is dishonorable, while
        the other side believes that honor doesn’t matter, so let’s commit war
        crimes, yay! There’s a happy middle ground which is never reached, and
        the story refuses to acknowledge.
      </p>
      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        After a lot of that rambling, my final verdict is that Ghost of Tsushima
        is a great game to explore if you just want to see some amazing graphics
        and beautiful landscapes. But for every other aspect, another game does
        it better: 
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Open World</b> - Breath of the Wild - Not as pretty, but with
				much stronger level design that rewards open exploration
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Stealth</b> - Hitman 3 - Sneaking isn't super fun unless disguises are available
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Action</b> - God of War - More satisfying while still
				being the same style
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Crafting</b> - Minecraft - This isn’t really a genre
				though. So why put it in the game? It's so vestigial.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Collectibles</b> - Mario Odyssey - Fun to explore and collect
				things in the world
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Story</b> - Witcher 3 / Cyberpunk 2077 - Choices that
				boil down to more than exactly how to kill the baddies
			</li>
		</ul>
